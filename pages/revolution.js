              In 2013, Facebook invented a new way of building websites. This
              new system, React.js, completely revolutionizes the process and
              practice of website development.

              Instead of chaining together long individual pages, like
              traditional websites, React websites are built with little chunks
              of code called components. These components are faster, easier to
              maintain, and are easily reused and customized, each serving a
              singular purpose.

              Two years later they shocked the world by releasing a similar
              system, React Native, for producing iOS and Android apps. Instead
              of having to master two completely separate development platforms,
              you can leverage the knowledge you already possessed from building
              websites and reapply it directly! This was a huge leap forward.

              This technology is now being used by companies like AirBnB,
              Microsoft, Netflix, Pinterest, Skype, Tesla, UberEats, and when
              Facebook purchased Instagram large portions of it were even

              Developers have since built on top of these systems by automating
              project setup and deployment, allowing creators to focus as much
              as possible on their work itself.
